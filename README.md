# Oracle of Seasons Tracker
Oracle of Seasons Tracker

Features Added:
- Cross Items
- Updated UI
- Portal Shuffle (partially done)
- Logic updates
- Improved code readability
- Re-write all the code and logic

To-Do:
- Logic for cross-items
- Different UI options
- Is hard\locations.json used for anything?
- Add portal locations to maps/portals.json for tracking when accessible

Logic:
- Mermaid Suit - Can go up waterfals
- Swimmers Ring - Can go up waterfalls
- Switch Hook - Swap with pots, implications in random dungeons, hit far switch
- Seed shooter - Hit far switch, counts for using seeds but not satchel use. Need to look at OoA logic
- Cane - Not sure of any logic changes, might break some puzzles (Lotus_RT gave some great examples in D6 of it being used to hit switches on otherside of blocks)
- Power Glove - Changes nothing, can push things a little faster
